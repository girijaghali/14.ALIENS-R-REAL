## Background

WAKE UP SHEEPLE! The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at **https://girijaghali.github.io/14.ALIENS-R-REAL/** have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! I had put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.


In this web application, I wrote code (using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS) that will create a table dynamically based upon a [dataset](Data/data.js). This also allows the users to search through the table for specific pieces of information.  

### Item -1 : Automatic Table and Multiple Search Categories

* Created a basic HTML web page.

* Using the ufo dataset available in the form of a JavaScript object, wrrote code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

  * The data listed have - `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment`.

* Using multiple `input` tags , this JavaScript code lets the user to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns: 

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`

*  `date/time` is expected in 'mm/dd/yyyy' format.  
*  `comments` returns records for substring match.  

### WIP: Paginated Table


### Dataset
